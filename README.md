![Alt text](/New_VC_Wall.png?raw=true "New VC Wall")
#### Name:
This	will	be	used	to	identify	your	wall	on	our	panel	and	reporting.
#### Allowed Offer Categories
This	determines	what	types	of	offers	will	show	up	on	your offer	wall.	We	recommend	leaving	this	to	the default	settings.
#### Points (plural)
The	plural	form	of	your	currency.	*Ex: Coins*
#### Points (singular)
The	singular	form	of	your	currency.	*Ex:	Coin*
#### Points (abbreviation)
The	abbreviated	form	of	your	currency.	If	there	is	no	abbreviated	form,	just	use	the	Plural form.	*Ex:	Cns	or	Coins*
#### Conversation rate
How	many	of	your	currency	is	$1	USD	worth?	*Ex:	100	would	mean you	award	100	Coins	for	every	$1	you	earn.*
#### URL of the wall
Enter	the	web	URL	the	wall	we	be	placed	on,	or	the	URL	of	your	App
#### Postback
The	URL	you	would	like	us	to	notify	when	a	conversion occurs.	Click	“More	Information	on	Postbacks” to	see	a	sample and	all	the	available	macros
#### Rounding
AdGate	Rewards	currently	supports	only	whole	integers.	You	can	choose how	you	want	decimals	rounded	when	awarding currency.

## Placing your wall
### Step 1: Obtain your wall ID
You can find your wall id [here](https://panel.adgatemedia.com/affiliate/vc-walls). It will look like the following image:
![Alt text](/Wall_Code_Example.png?raw=true "Wall code example")
You can see our two codes here are **nQ** and **ng**
### Step 2: Determine how you will create your user id
The	user	id	may	be	any	string	up	to	255	characters	long.	Although	a	simple	integer	
representing	a	user	id	may	be	used,	we	highly	suggest	hashing	the	user	id	with	a	secret	
salt	and	using	that	value	instead.	This	will	prevent	your	users	from	guessing	random	
integers	and	altering	another	users'	offer	wall. Below is an example how to do that in PHP.

The following example assumes you have a user id from a database.
```php
<?php
// This value is from the database but here as an example
$userId = 1;

// This is just a random or sudo random string of letters
$userSalt = "thisismys$ltv@lu3";

// This will combined the two above variables
// and create a HASH of the combination
$userIdForVCWall = md5($userSalt.$userId);
```

#### Step 3: Adding the iframe to your site
You will take both of the pieces of information obtained in Step 1 & 2 and create an iframe using the following guideline: `https://wall.adgaterewards.com/**YOUR WALL ID (Step 1)**/**YOUR USER ID (Step 2)**`. For example:
```html
<iframe src="https://wall.adgaterewards.com/nQ/6d0007e52f7afb7d5a0650b0ffb8a4d1"></iframe>
```

It is also recommended to set the iframe height to that of the users browser. This can be done in either [CSS](http://www.tagindex.net/css/frame/width_height.html) or [inline of the iframe.](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_iframe_height.asp)
